**Made with React.js and hosted on Firebase!**

>[!NOTE]
>This website is currently in beta and bugs will be a-plenty! Please report bugs if you find any!

Personal website made with CSS, React, and other frameworks from scratch. It took a number of hours making everything work and look good so I hope you enjoy accessing it.

>[!TIP]
>You can access the deployed website at [mnkjoshi.me](https://mnkjoshi.me) or follow the following instructions to build and deploy it yourself.

Clone the repo locally to your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/mnkjoshi/mnkjoshi.github.io
```

Then install all packages and necessary files with npm:
```
npm install
```

Once all necessary files are downloaded, you can run the website yourself using npm:
```
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, to deploy and test it elsewhere you can:
```
npm run build
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Please note that the code in this repo requires permission to re-use in any form. Please contact me on github to ensure you are compliant with the license.
